If you are *registering content* (RC) for DRCDP, please fill out the requested information below.   If you want to create an issue about something else, please delete the text below and title your issue as appropriate.  

To register (or edit) some or all of the DRCDP RC, please title this github issue as follows:  
"RC for " + your source_name (as you define below), and indicate if you are modifying your input from an earlier issue

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The following are required registered content (with example content for each item in **bold**). Please replace the example text below with your information to the right of the equal sign (DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE EQUAL SIGN):
1) downscaling_source_id  = 'LOCA2'
2) institution_id = 'UCSD-SIO'
3) region = 'NAM'
4) A list of CMIP variable_ids that the above information refers to.  In most cases it will only be for one variable_id.  If it is for more than one, please make sure your source_description is sufficiently general to apply to all relevant variable_ids.

The above RC is a first step to ensuring DRCDP data can be identified and retrieved from ESGF. As dataset is being prepared some "Controlled Vocabulary (CV) will also be required.  Examples include "CMIP_experiment", "realization", "frequency" and "variable"
