# Decision Relevant Community Data Products (DRCDP)

The need for actionable meteorological and hydrologic information continues to grow, as communities work to improve predictions and projections of the natural system and assess risks from weather hazards. Decision relevant Earth System data is indispensible to this need, providing data at the scales needed by a broad community of stakeholders, practitioners and other end-users.

### THIS REPOSITORY IS CURRENTLY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
It will be used to document the status of the project, include guidance for dataset contributors, and manage critical metadata used to describe and deliver datasets.

## Acknowledgment

The repository content has been collected from many contributors. The structure of content and tools required to maintain it was developed by Earth System and computer scientists from the Program for Coordinated Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison ([PCMDI](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/)) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ([LLNL](https://www.llnl.gov/)).

This work is sponsored by the Regional and Global Model Analysis ([RGMA](https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/program/regional-global-model-analysis)) program of the Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences Division ([EESSD](https://science.osti.gov/ber/Research/eessd)) in the Office of Biological and Environmental Research ([BER](https://science.osti.gov/ber)) within the Department of Energy's ([DOE](https://www.energy.gov/)) Office of Science ([OS](https://science.osti.gov/)). The work at PCMDI is performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

This work was also funded by a contract from the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program ([ESTCP](https://serdp-estcp.mil/)) under Project NH24-8916.
